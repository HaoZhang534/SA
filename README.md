knapsack
========

The *inst* directory contains data for experiments. The *sol* directory contains right answers for experiments checking.

Format of instance files:
* ID
* the number of items
* the knapsack capacity
* sequence of weight-cost pairs

Format of solution files:
* ID
* the number of items
* the best cost value
* sequence of 0/1: if the i-th element of sequence equal to 1 then we take the i-th item to knapsack overwise we don't take the item to knapsack
